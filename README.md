The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, leading to significant changes in our daily lives, economies, and healthcare systems. To gain insights into the dynamics of this global crisis, we conducted a comprehensive data analysis using five diverse datasets: df_country, df_covid, df_day, df_world, and df_fgroup. In this analysis.
